# LSTM-autoencoder
The purpose of this project is to implement a distributed version of LSTM Autoencoder using GPU. LSTM autoencoder is a part of a bigger model LSTM-Node2vec that is implemented and submitted for publication. LSTM-Node2vec model is a neural network model for graph embedding that can be used to represent graphs in different data mining tasks including link prediction, anomaly detection and node classification and outperforms state-of-the-art models in most of the cases.
We are interested in having a distributed implementation of this model. LSTM-Node2vec consists of two part: LSTM-autoencoder and Node2vec. In this project our goal is to implement the LSTM-autoencoder component. Below, we describe LSTM autoencoder structure and its training.
